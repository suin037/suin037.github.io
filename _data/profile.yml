  blurb: >-
    <p>To broaden my horizons, I like to step outside my comfort zone and <strong>explore new experiences</strong>. I do exchange-reading with friends from other majors, travel whenever possible, and attend seminars across disciplines. Recently I even heard a talk by an author from our exchange-reading list, and my most recent trip was to Sydney, Australia.</p>
